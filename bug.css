The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur when using this function. One such error is forgetting to add spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function. For example, the following code will not work as expected: `width:calc(100%-10px);` The correct way to write this would be: `width:calc(100% - 10px);` Another error that can occur is using incompatible units within the `calc()` function. For example, trying to add pixels and percentages together directly will result in an error. To solve this, make sure you are using compatible units. Also, using nested `calc()` functions can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, so it's better to simplify such expressions. Finally, it's important to remember that the `calc()` function only works with numerical values, so you can't use strings or other data types directly.
